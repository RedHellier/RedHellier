I am a Software developer with a first-class degree in Computer Science. 
Since University, I have worked in education due to my passion for helping people. 
Here I honed my team working, leadership, mentoring and communication skills. 
I now want to use these skills and my technical knowledge to develop software that improves and emboldens people in their daily lives.
